Required Tools
---
- Soldering Iron (Generic)
- Solder Wire (Lead Free)
- Wire Cutters (Capable of stripping 22 and 24 AWG wiring)
- Open Barrel Terminal Crimper (Capable of crimping 22 and 24 AWG wiring)
- Wire Cutters (Generic)
- Silicone 22AWG Flex Wire (multiple colours)
- Hook-up Wire 22AWG (multiple colours)
- Heat Shrink Tubing (multiple sizes)
- Desolder Pump

Optional:
- Thin Tipped Tweezers (makes the soldering of the surface mount resistors much easier)
- Helping Hands (makes the soldering of wires much easier)
- Fine Conical Soldering Iron Tip (makes the soldering of small components easier)
- Multimeter (not necessary for the functionality of the build, however is very useful in the building and testing phases)
