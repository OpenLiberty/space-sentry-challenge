The Space Sentry project is powered by an Arduino MEGA, combined with a custom built PCB and wiring. This folder contains all the resources needed to replicate the hardware as well as all physical components of the Space Sentry project.

- Take a look at the [parts-list.md](parts-list.md) file for the full list of components.
- For a brief overview on the specifics of the PCB design, please refer to the [pcb-shield.md](pcb-shield.md) file.
- The PCB shield design has been provided as the [pcb-gerber.zip](pcb-gerber.zip) file, for instructions on how to order the PCBs, refer to the [pcb-ordering.md](pcb-ordering.md) file.
- Once the PCB has been ordered and received, following the soldering instructions provided in the [pcb-soldering.md](pcb-soldering.md) file.
